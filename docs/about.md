# About Church Tools

## From the Founder

Howdy, my name is Ryan Hayden.  I'm a pastor who lives in Mattoon, IL and who has been making websites since 2004.  I got the idea to make Church Tools (which used to be called Simple Church Tools and before that was called SitesforChurch) at a revival service.  A preacher I admire was talking about how God used his church to start all kinds of out-of-the-box ministries that help people and missionaries around the world and I felt a distinct call to use my web development skills to do something for churches.  That was four years ago, and there have been a ton of ups and downs along the way, but I'm proud of what Church Tools is becoming.

## Our Goal

The goal of Church Tools is simple: **make inexpensive web-based software that improves the life and ministry of small churches everywhere.**  I'm not focused on making software for mega-churches or hip seeker-senstative churches, there are tons of larger companies meeting their needs.  I want to help the church with between 10-200 members, that is more conservative than contemporary.

As a small church pastor myself, I know what it's like to work in a smaller church, preach three times a week, organize and plan.  I'm very much scratching my own itch with these tools and I hope it shows.

## What is Row & Table

Row and Table is the name on the LLC.  I used to run a small software-for-hire business with a couple of designers and developers and that was the name on the shingle.  I still like the sound of it, and didn't want to go through the hastle of reincorporating under a differnt name, so I'm keeping it.
